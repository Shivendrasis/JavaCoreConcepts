#Definition:

Multithreading in Java is a feature that allows a program to execute multiple threads (smallest units of a task) simultaneously, improving performance and making programs faster and more responsive.

#Why use it?

Better CPU utilization – runs multiple tasks in parallel.
Responsive UI – e.g., in GUI applications, one thread can handle user input while another processes data.
Faster execution – tasks that are independent can run simultaneously.


##Explanation for interview:

Here, we created two threads (t1 and t2) that run concurrently.
Each thread executes the run() method independently.
Using threads, the CPU can perform multiple tasks at the same time.



#There are two ways:

a) Extending Thread class

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // start() calls run() internally
    }
}



b) Implementing Runnable interface

class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();
    }
}



##Thread Life Cycle

States:

New – Thread created but not started.

Runnable – Ready to run; waiting for CPU.

Running – Thread executing.

Waiting/Blocked – Waiting for a resource or notification.

Terminated – Thread finished execution.
