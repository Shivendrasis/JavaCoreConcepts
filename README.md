# JavaCoreConcepts
here is a clean interview-quality example using a real-world scenario (Payment System).



🧠What Concepts You Demonstrated?
Concept	Shown in Example	How?
Interface	✔	Payment defines required methods
Abstraction	✔	User doesn’t know how payment works internally
Implementation Class	✔	UpiPayment, CreditCardPayment
Polymorphism	✔	Same interface reference calling different behaviors
Loose Coupling	✔	You can change implementation without changing main code
Extensibility	✔	You can add PayPal, EMI, NetBanking easily



# Interface vs Abstract Class

- Interface defines a contract or buleprint (what to do)
- Abstract class allows partial implementation (what + partly how)
- Supports abstraction, polymorphism and loose coupling
- Common in framework design and real-world applications
